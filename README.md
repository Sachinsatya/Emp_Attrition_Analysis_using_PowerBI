Attrition is a crucial metric that indicates the percentage of employees who leave an organization, either voluntarily or involuntarily, due to reasons such as resignation, termination, death, or retirement. It is an essential indicator that HR departments use to monitor and improve workforce planning and management. High attrition rates can negatively impact an organization's performance, leading to recruitment struggles, increased hiring costs, and additional workload for remaining employees, resulting in stress and potentially further impacting organizational performance.
The goal is to use Power Query to gain insights into the important factors associated with attrition from collected data. The HR department can then take preventive measures to control attrition rates within the organization
To achieve this goal, the following steps can be taken using Power Query:

1. Clean and prepare the data by removing irrelevant or redundant information, and transforming data to an appropriate format.

2. Check the data and its data types to ensure consistency and accuracy.

3. Identify and address blank cells to avoid incorrect or biased analysis.

4. Find missing values and determine whether to fill them or exclude them from the analysis.

5. Remove duplicates to avoid duplicated analysis results.

6. Remove columns with constant values as they do not contribute to the analysis.

- By performing these steps, HR departments can gain insights into attrition patterns and identify factors that lead to employee departure, allowing for preventative measures to be put in place to control attrition rates within the organization.
